# Pig-Game
The pig game is a fun and simple game where two players roll a dice to see who the first to 100 is. If a player rolls a one on their turn then they lose all the points accrued during their turn and it automatically goes to the next player. The player may choose to hold and keep their points which causes the other player to roll.
